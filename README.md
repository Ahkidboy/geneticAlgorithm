# geneticAlgorithm
This is a genetic algorithm tha simulates natural selection(survival of the fittest). It learns to say Hello

## How it works
I create a new "organism" a certain amount of times to simulate a generation, then, it generates a random string and determines the fitness based on how close it is to the actual word. Then, I push them to an array When it does that it then sorts the "organisms" in decending order so I can determine the best 50% and breed them together by picking a certain amount of letters from its "genes" (the length and which ones is random). Then, it will repeat.

## Where Im At
I am currently on the breeding process.
